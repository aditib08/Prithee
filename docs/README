    This program entry point will be the Main class.

    This program takes one argument: a sonnet

    The program prints out the sonnet until it reaches a random word in the sonnet, and then
    prints a series of underscores. The user is prompted for the next word and the program indicates
    whether it was correct or incorrect. The sonnet then restarts and stops at a different word. This
    continues until 3 rounds have been played.

    PSEUDOCODE

    let randomIndex be a valid index in sonnet
    let totalPlays be the number of rounds the user has played

    for each word in sonnet
        print until randomIndex
        let nextWord be the word right after randomIndex

        if randomIndex
            print series of underscores
            prompt user for guess
                if guess is nextWord
                    print correct
                print incorrect

            increment totalPlays

    TESTS
    if the user inputs the wrong word, the program should print incorrect
    if the user inputs a incorrect case but the word is correct, the program should still print correct
    if the user inputs a null string, the user should be prompted to print a string
